Streamify Analytics Dashboard (Overview)
Developed by Nnajiofor Uchenna Franklin

Streamify Analytics Dashboard is a responsive single-page application (SPA) built using React to provide insights into key metrics, data visualizations, and recent stream data for the fictional music streaming service, "Streamify." This dashboard enables the management team to track user activity, revenue, and content performance efficiently.

Features
The dashboard consists of the following key sections:

1: Key Metrics:
   Total Users: Displays the total number of registered users on the platform.
   Active Users: Shows the number of users who streamed at least one song in the last 30 days.
   Total Streams: The total number of song streams on the platform.
   Revenue: Total revenue generated from subscriptions and ads.
   Top Artist: Displays the artist with the most streams in the past 30 days.
2: Data Visualization:
   User Growth Chart: A line chart representing user growth (both total users and active users) over the past 12 months.
   Revenue Distribution: A pie chart showing the distribution of revenue from different sources (e.g., subscriptions, ads).
   Top 5 Streamed Songs: A bar chart that showcases the top 5 most-streamed songs over the past 30 days.
3: Data Table:
   A detailed table showing recent streams, including:
   Song Name
   Artist
   Date Streamed
   Stream Count
   User ID
   The table supports sorting by date and stream count, and filtering by artist or song name.
4: User Interaction:
   Sorting & Filtering: Allows users to sort data by various metrics and filter results by artist or song.
   Chart Interaction: Users can hover over points in the charts for more detailed data and click on pie chart segments to filter the table by revenue source.
5: Bonus Features:
   Optional features could include additional analytics such as monthly revenue growth, average stream duration, or user demographics.
   Technical Details
   Frontend: React (with hooks for state management and React Context API for global state)
   CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design
   Mock Data: Data is mocked using JSON files or MirageJS for a simulated backend
   Data Visualizations: recharts library for creating interactive charts
   State Management: Managed using React's Context API for simplicity
   Performance Optimization: Techniques such as lazy loading, memoization, and code splitting have been used to improve the performance of the application.
   Running the Application
   Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/uche7/streamify.git
cd streamify-dashboard
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Application:

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will start the application on http://localhost:3000.

Testing
Unit tests are included for key components, written with Jest and React Testing Library. You can run the tests using the command:
bash
Copy code
npm test
Deployment
The application can be easily deployed on platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages. If you wish to deploy, ensure you have created a production build by running:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Future Improvements
Integrating real-time data from a backend service or API.
Adding user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for different dashboard views.
Implementing additional charts and visualizations based on user feedback.
Trade-offs
For simplicity and demonstration purposes, the app uses mock data rather than connecting to a live backend.
The focus was on building a user-friendly and visually appealing dashboard. Some advanced features like animations or additional filtering could be added in future iterations.
Conclusion
This project provides a full-featured analytics dashboard for Streamify, offering key insights through interactive charts, metrics, and data tables. The dashboard is designed with scalability and responsiveness in mind, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
